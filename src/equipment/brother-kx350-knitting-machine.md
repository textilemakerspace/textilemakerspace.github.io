Hello, I'm the most affordable way to keep your family in the height of fashion... as of the 80's or 90's, at least. I'm a low-drama, fairly straightforward knitting machine, the least cantankerous of all the flat knitting machines at the Makerspace.

## Supplies
I like very thin yarn, especially on cones. If the yarn isn't flowing freely and evenly, I might jam.

## Fun facts
I was donated by Ryan Lieu from the Stanford Libraries Preservation group!
